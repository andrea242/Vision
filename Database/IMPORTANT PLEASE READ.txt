Our files are not uploaded as of time we did it as we were using GitHub without much knowledge of it, 
We all were individually uploading our just on on our on Git without all of us in the same group.

In this group each file we uploaded was downloaded off our account and reuploaded to the group folder, so it is accurately what we all added to it.
Apoloigies for the inconvience, yet it gave us more practice of the collaborative software.
